# Sub-Saharan Africa Adolescent Fertility Rate Visualization

## Overview

This project aims to visualize and analyze the adolescent fertility rate in Sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2015. The visualization provides insights into the distribution of fertility rates among countries in the Sub-Saharan African region, shedding light on the challenges and variations in adolescent reproductive health.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from [World Bank]. It includes information about adolescent fertility rates, categorized by country, and year. The dataset i transformed is cleaned and processed to focus specifically on Sub-Saharan African countries for the year 2015.

## Visualization

The main visualization is an interactive choropleth map that showcases the adolescent fertility rates across Sub-Saharan Africa. Each country is color-coded based on its fertility rate, allowing users to easily identify regions with higher or lower rates. Additionally, hovering over a country provides detailed information, including the specific fertility rate value.
